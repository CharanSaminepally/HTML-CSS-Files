            Some early treatises—such as those 
             of Cicero on the pleasantness of 
             old age or on the art of “divination,
             ” Seneca on anger or clemency, and 
             Plutarch on the passing of oracles—presage
             to a certain degree the form and 
             tone of the essay, but not until 
             the late 16th century was the flexible 
             and deliberately nonchalant and 
             versatile form of the essay perfected 
             by the French writer Michel de Montaigne.

             Choosing the name essai to emphasize 
             that his compositions were attempts or 
             endeavours, a groping toward the expression
             of his personal thoughts and experiences,
             Montaigne used the essay as a means of 
             self-discovery. His Essais, published in
             their final form in 1588, are still
             considered among the finest of their 
             kind.

             Later writers who most nearly 
             recall the charm of Montaigne include,
             in England, Robert Burton, though his
             whimsicality is more erudite,
             Sir Thomas Browne, and Laurence Sterne,
             and in France, with more self-consciousness 
             and pose, André Gide and Jean Cocteau.</p>
