        <h3>Cars Info</h3>
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cars came into global use during the 20th century,
     and developed economies depend on them. 
     The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the car 
     when German inventor Karl Benz patented his 
     Benz Patent-Motorwagen.</p>
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cars became
     widely available in the early 20th century.
     One of the first cars accessible to the masses 
     was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured 
     by the Ford Motor Company.</p> 
     <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cars were rapidly adopted
     in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn
     carriages and carts, but took much longer to be 
     accepted in Western Europe and other parts of
     the world.</p>
