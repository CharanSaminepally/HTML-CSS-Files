        <p>Cars came into global use during 
            the 20th century, and developed 
            economies depend on them. The 
            year 1886 is regarded as the birth 
            year of the car when German inventor 
            Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-
            Motorwagen.[1][4][5] Cars became widely 
            available in the early 20th century. 
            One of the first cars accessible to 
            the masses was the 1908 Model T, an 
            American car manufactured by the Ford 
            Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted 
            in the US, where they replaced animal-
            drawn carriages and carts, but took much 
            longer to be accepted in Western Europe 
            and other parts of the world.</p>
